# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

To mine solution for the challange to create Ping:s landing page. A challange by frontendmentor.io.

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out Ping:s coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible given by the challanger.

Iam able to use any tools I like to tackle this challange. I used HTML/CSS/JS vanilla to complete the challange.

Goal for this challange are that my users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## Where to find everything

I was given a design to follow and that is stored inside the `/design` folder.

I had to challange my self by setting the `margin`, `padding`, `font-size` etc. due to having static `png/jpg` images.

In my Images folder i was given some background images and 2 icons, the logo icons are from `fontawesome`

`style-guide.md` file containing the information that I need, such as color palette and fonts.
